To get this running on your local server do these things:
1. Make sure your apache server is running on your mac (go to localhost in your browser and see if things are looking good). Maybe use python server instead?
2. Put everything in a "fb-viz" folder in "/Library/WebServer/Documents". This is where your localhost files are stored
3. Go to "/etc/hosts" and add this line "127.0.0.1 local.bhaviksingh.com". Instead of 127... you may have to use whatever IP your computer is one!
4. Point ur browser to "local.bhaviksingh.com/fb-viz". BAM! LOGIN!
